---

### Project description

This full-stack project is going to be diveded i two repositories: Frontend (*webapp-react*) and Backend (*webapp-express*).
Each day of work has different goals, mimicking what an actual web developer job consists of.

## Frontend

### Day 2

#### MILESTONE 1

- Let's set up a new React project using Vite
- Clean up the app by removing unnecessary example files and code
- Install the required dependencies: React Router, Axios, and Bootstrap (if you want to use it)

#### MILESTONE 2

- Create a basic layout for the application and set up the routes for the different pages
- Create 2 pages:
    - The home page, where the list of movies will be displayed 
    - The detail page for a single movie

#### MILESTONE 3

- Configure the backend app (repo *webapp-express*) to accept requests from our React application by installing and setting up the **CORS** middleware
- Make an Ajax call from the React project's home page to fetch the list of books

#### Bonus

- Structure the project in a way that takes advantage of React component reusability and props!
- Add a search field on the movies page to search across all relevant fields in the database (e.g. title, abstract)
- Improve the visual appearance of the application
